## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Apply appropriate preprocessing techniques to numerical and categorical features to prepare raw data for machine learning algorithms.

* Evaluate the predictive performance of classification and regression models by interpreting key metrics and analyzing the bias-variance tradeoff.

* Construct a complete end-to-end supervised learning pipeline that integrates data preparation, model training, and validation.
